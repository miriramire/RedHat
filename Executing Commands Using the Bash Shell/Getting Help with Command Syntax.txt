To use a command effectively, a user needs to know what options and arguments it takes and in what order it expects them (the syntax of the command). Most commands have a --help option. This causes the command to print a description of what it does, a "usage statement" that describes the command's syntax, and a list of the options it accepts and what they do.

Usage statements may seem complicated and difficult to read. They become much simpler to understand once a user becomes familiar with a few basic conventions:

Square brackets, [], surround optional items.
Anything followed by ... represents an arbitrary-length list of items of that type.
Multiple items separated by pipes, |, means only one of them can be specified.
Text in angle brackets, <>, represents variable data. For example, <filename> means â€œinsert the filename you wish to use hereâ€. Sometimes these variables are simply written in capital letters (e.g., FILENAME).

Consider the first usage statement for the date command:
[student@desktopX ~]$ date --help
date [OPTION]... [+FORMAT]
This indicates that date can take an optional list of options ([OPTION]...), followed by an optional format string, prefixed with a plus character, +, that defines how the current date should be displayed ([+FORMAT]). Since both of these are optional, date will work even if it is not given options or arguments (it will print the current date and time using its default format).

System Documentation

Manual pages, or man pages, consist of system documentation which may be installed that provides detailed information about specific kinds of topics. The manual is divided into sections numbered from 1 through 9, and each section is for a specific kind of information. For example, section 1 covers user programs; section 8 covers administratives programs. Man pages are referred to by their name, followed by the number of the relevant section in parentheses: bash(1) is the man page for the bash command in section 1 of the manual.
To read a man page, enter the man command, followed optionally by the section of the manual for the man page and the name of the page itself.
[student@desktopX ~]$ man 1 bash
