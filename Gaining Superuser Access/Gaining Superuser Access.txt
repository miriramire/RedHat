$ - Regular user
# - Root User

*Log in as Root
$su -
*Log out as root
Ctrl + d
$logout

If you want to recall the previous command, you could use a double bang (!!) like that.
ricardo@DESKTOP-JT8C2C8:~$ useradd barney
useradd: Permission denied.
useradd: cannot lock /etc/passwd; try again later.
ricardo@DESKTOP-JT8C2C8:~$ sudo !!
So !! represents the useradd barney command.

Sudo is all about delegating other commands as different users.
Should you want to log in as the root user via sudo, you could use the command sudo -i
