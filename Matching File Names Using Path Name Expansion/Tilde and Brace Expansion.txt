Tilde Expansion
The tilde character (~), when followed by a slash delimiter, matches the current user's home directory. When followed by a string of characters up to a slash, it will be interpreted as a username, if one matches. If no username matches, then an actual tilde followed by the string of characters will be returned.

Brace Expansion
Brace expansion is used to generate discretionary strings of characters. Braces contain a comma-separated list of strings, or a sequence expression. The result includes the text preceding or following the brace definition. Brace expansions may be nested, one inside another.

[student@desktopX glob]$ echo {Sunday,Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday}.log
Sunday.log Monday.log Tuesday.log Wednesday.log
[student@desktopX glob]$ echo file{1..3}.txt
file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
[student@desktopX glob]$ echo file{a..c}.txt
filea.txt fileb.txt filec.txt
[student@desktopX glob]$ echo file{a,b}{1,2}.txt
filea1.txt filea2.txt fileb1.txt fileb2.txt
[student@desktopX glob]$ echo file{a{1,2},b,c}.txt
filea1.txt filea2.txt fileb.txt filec.txt
[student@desktopX glob]$
