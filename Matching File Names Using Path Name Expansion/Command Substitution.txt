Command substitution allows the output of a command to replace the command itself. Command substitution occurs when a command is enclosed with a beginning dollar sign and parenthesis, $(command), or with backticks, `command`. The form with backticks is older, and has two disadvantages: 1) it can be easy to visually confuse backticks with single quote marks, and 2) backticks cannot be nested inside backticks. The $(command) form can nest multiple command expansions inside each other.
