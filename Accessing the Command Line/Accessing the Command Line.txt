$ means that you are logged in as a normal user.
# means that you are logged in as the administrative user(root).
ls -l /boot  (ls{command} -l{option} /boot{argument})
  listening
  -l tells us how we want to execute the command.

Options come in two formats:
- shortest (-l): -l stands for long. And to indicate that we are using the abbreviated form of the option, we use a single dash (-) Now, when you make use of the double dash (--), you are telling the Linux command line that it is not to interpret every single letter in the word as an individual option.
- longest (--all): the shortest of this option is -a, but you must not use -all, because it interprets every letter, in this way: -a (all), -l (long listening) and -l (long listening) that is redundant.

CTRL + L cleans the terminal
CTRL + D closes the terminal
CTRL + V means exit or logout; it means the same thing.
SSH (ip or url) you can login to a remote shell. Example:
  ssh servera.lab.example.com
  
  You can create a private and public key in this way:
    ls .ssh
    ssh-keygen
    Enter the private key (rsa): ******
    secure with passphrase? (if yes type the key/if no press enter)
    ssh-copy-id servera.lab.example.com (Copy the key created)
