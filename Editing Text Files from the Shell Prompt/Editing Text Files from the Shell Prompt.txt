vim is a really powerful editor and it has three modes of operation.

$sudo yum install vim
$vim

vim is operating in command mode right now.
So to go to insert mode from command mode, use the i button on your keyboard.
I need to change modes because when I'm inside insert mode right now, any keystrokes that I initiate on my keyboard will be directed into this file as content.
I’m going to hit Esc
use a colon (:) and now I'm going to use a special vim function called write.

$:write
$:w /var/tmp/hello_world

Now let’s quit vim.
To quit vim, I would make use of colon, to go to ex-mode,

$:q

Now let's use the command cat against /var/tmp/hello_world

$ cat /var/tmp/hello_world
Hello World

So let's go and make a couple of changes to this file right now.

$ vim /var/tmp/hello_world

Now let's move on to command mode, and have look at some vim commands.
 yy to copy a line.
 To paste a line, you could use p.
 If you wanted to paste that line five times, you could use 5p.
 So if you wanted to delete that word, you could say dw.
 cw deleted the word that my cursor was over
 So if I wanted to delete the character "e" I could just say x
 3x would delete the next three characters.
 And to delete the text from your current cursor position to the end of the line, I could make use of d$.
 If you make a mistake inside vim, you can undo your transactions by saying u.
 If you want to delete an entire line you could use the instruction dd
 So if you want to delete the next 100 lines, I could say 100dd.
 To save a file which already has a name, I’m going to use :w and then we’ll save. And now we’re going to quit at the same time.
 
$:wq

Another way in which you could use the save and quit function is to use an uppercase ZZ once you are inside the command mode.

If you have made a change to a file and you want to avoid those changes, I could say Esc+:q

$:q!
