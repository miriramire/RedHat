Clous computing is a model for enabling, ubiquitous, convinient, on-demand network access to share a pool of configurable computer resources. Characteristics:
*Self-service (Allow cloud consumers to be able to provision instances with their computer resources on their own)
*Multilatency (Allow multiple cloud consumers to share the underlying hardware)
*Elasticity (Being able to scale out add aditional resources on demand)
*Telemetry (Resources need to be able to be monitored and metered)

Cloud workloads:
The goal there is to be able to scale out. Being able to add aditional instances.

Cloud Deployment Model:
*Private Cloud:
Used by a single organization, they have a hardware residing in their own datacenter.
*Hybrid Cloud:
We use the private cloud for the core of our resources, the standard amount of our resources, and when we need it we can expand for the public cloud.
*Public Cloud:
Available to general public, it is run by a cloud provider.

Infrastucture as-a-services:
*Open Physical
*Open Virtualization
*Open Private CLoud
*Open Hybrid Cloud

Platform as-a-services:
*Open Development
*Open Deployment
*Open CLoud PLatforms
*Open Operations

Open Hybrid Cloud:
Redhat provide an Open Hybrid Cloud

Virtualization vs Cloud Computing
On of the ideas of virtualization is that these infrastructures are considered stateful. We want to be able to scale them up.
In the cloud infrastructure, we have the same basic infrastructure elements. The purpose of Cloud Computing is to allow for greater scalability. It gives us a model that is ultimately decoupling.
