Traditional virtualization has limited scalability. Cloud computing is an abstraction of the underlying infrastructure.
Administrators are able to focus less on available hardware and more on sizing and application requirements.
Cloud infrastructure are stateless, the application can run anywhere and data is virtually made available from any computing node.
Cloud computing allows the abstraction of a lot of services, DNS infractructures, firewall, databases....
APIs are the cornerstone of cloud computing. This gives to the developers the ability to write their own infrastructure.
RHEL OpenStack platform is really suited for companies who want to propose an on-demand fast provisioning infrastructure, who need multi-tenancy and isolation across customers and projects.

What is openstack?
OpenStack is a combination of open source tools (known as projects) that use pooled virtual resources to build and manage private and public clouds.
