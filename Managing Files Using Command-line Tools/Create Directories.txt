The mkdir command creates one or more directories or subdirectories, generating errors if the file name already exists or when attempting to create a directory in a parent directory that doesn't exist. The -p parent option creates missing parent directories for the requested destination. Be cautious when using mkdir -p, since accidental spelling mistakes create unintended directories without generating error messages.
In the following example, a user attempts to use mkdir to create a subdirectory named Watched in the existing Videos directory, but mistypes the directory name.
[student@desktopX ~]$ mkdir Video/Watched
mkdir: cannot create directory `Video/Watched': No such file or directory

The mkdir failed because Videos was misspelled and the directory Video does not exist. If the user had used mkdir with the -p option, there would be no error and the user would end up with two directories, Videos and Video, and the Watched subdirectory would be created in the wrong place.

[student@desktopX ~]$ mkdir Videos/Watched
[student@desktopX ~]$ cd Documents
[student@desktopX Documents]$ mkdir ProjectX ProjectY
[student@desktopX Documents]$ mkdir -p Thesis/Chapter1 Thesis/Chapter2 Thesis/Chapter3
[student@desktopX Documents]$ cd
[student@desktopX ~]$ ls -R Videos Documents
Documents:
ProjectX  ProjectY  Thesis  thesis_chapter1.odf  thesis_chapter2.odf

Documents/ProjectX:

Documents/ProjectY:

Documents/Thesis:
Chapter1  Chapter2  Chapter3

Documents/Thesis/Chapter1:

Documents/Thesis/Chapter2:

Documents/Thesis/Chapter3:

Videos:
blockbuster1.ogg  blockbuster2.ogg  Watched

Videos/Watched:

[student@desktopX ~]$

The last mkdir created three ChapterN subdirectories with one command. The -p parent option created the missing parent directory Thesis.
