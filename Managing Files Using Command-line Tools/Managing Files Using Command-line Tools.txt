 create a brand new file.
 $touch foo
 you can see that the file foo has been created as an empty file.
 $ls -lh foo
-rw-rw-r--. 1 ec2-user ec2-user 0 Jan 24 14:40 foo
Change the name
$mv foo bar
$ ls -lh bar
-rw-rw-r--. 1 ec2-user ec2-user 0 Jan 24 14:40 bar
moving the file from one location to another location.
$mv bar /var/tmp
$ ls -lh /var/tmp/bar
-rw-rw-r--. 1 ec2-user ec2-user 0 Jan 24 14:40 /var/tmp/bar

So to copy an entire directory, we can’t use the cp command on its own. So if I wanted to copy the /etc/ssh/ directory, and to indicate to you that this is in fact a directory, I’m just going to complete that path with a trailing forward slash. And, where I’m going to copy the ssh directory is to my current location, and it’s going to error out.
$ cp /etc/ssh/ .
cp: omitting directory ‘/etc/ssh/’
So we’re going to copy the ssh directory along with all its children, along with all these sub-items below ssh.
$ cp -r /etc/ssh/ .
$ ls
ssh
$ mv ssh hss
Delete a directory
$rm hss
rm: cannot remove ‘hss’: Is a directory
$ rmdir hss
rmdir: failed to remove ‘hss’: Directory not empty
$ rm -r hss
$ ls
