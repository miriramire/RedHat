A single period (.) means the current directory,
whereas the double period (..) means the parent directory.
An tilde (~) refers to the currently logged on user’s home directory,
whereas we have tilde (~) and then a username like fred that refers to the user’s home directory, the user fred.

typing in cd ~student, and I know right now that I'm in student’s home directory...
by typing in pwd, so it tells me exactly where I am.
cd ~ that takes to my home directory.
cd - that will take me to the directory I was previously in.
